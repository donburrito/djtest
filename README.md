## Photography Section

<!--In order to add an image to the photography section, use the following steps:
- Add a `jpeg` image to the folder [assets/theme/images/photography/](assets/theme/images/photography) in the format `photo-#.jpeg` replacing `#` with a number in order (1, 2, 3..)
- The numbered photos in the above folder will be displayed in order
- Go to the file [assets/theme/js/photography.js](assets/theme/js/photography.js)
- Change the variable called `NUM_PHOTOS` at the top of the file to be the **highest numbered photo**
- This should update the photography section with all the images from the photography assets folder.

> Images must be named correctly and be in jpeg format-->

1. get the latest zip of the entire site and open LOCAL
2. Put the new photos in LOCAL Photography folder
3. Terminal window in LOCAL Photography dir
4. run `ls -1 *.jpg >! photo_list.txt` _OR_ add the files manually and then update the text list manually
5. then drop new files into REMOTE Photography dir
 
All of above applies to Artwork with obvious naming change of folders
